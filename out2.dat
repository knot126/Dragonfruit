if statement "there's a glass in my hand" is coincedentally corresponds reallity, statement "i think there's a glass in my hand because there's a glass in my hand" is still false, because you think there's a glass in your hand not because there's a glass in your hand, but because you live in an illusion that makes you think there's a glass in your hand regardless of reality
